# .bypass - Sync Python files directly to prod WITHOUT Cython compilation
#
# This file specifies which Python files should be synced to prod as .py files
# instead of being compiled to .so files. These files will bypass Cython compilation
# entirely and be copied directly to the prod branch.
#
# SYNTAX:
# -------
# - Exact file paths:         path/to/file.py
# - Wildcard patterns:        config_*.py, *_settings.py
# - Directory patterns:       config/, scripts/
# - Comments:                 Lines starting with # are ignored
# - Blank lines:              Also ignored
#
# EXAMPLES:
# ---------
# Bypass specific files:
#   setup.py
#   config/settings.py
#   __init__.py
#
# Bypass by pattern:
#   config_*.py            # All files starting with config_
#   *_settings.py          # All files ending with _settings.py
#   __init__.py            # Package initialization files
#
# Bypass entire directories:
#   config/                # All files in config directory
#   scripts/               # All files in scripts directory
#   migrations/            # All files in migrations directory
#
# Common bypass patterns below - uncomment as needed:
# ----------------------------------------------------

# Configuration files (often need to remain editable in prod)
# config/
# settings.py
# config.py

# Package initialization files (usually minimal and not worth compiling)
# **/__init__.py

# Migration files (should remain as Python for clarity)
# migrations/
# **/migrations/

# CLI and script files (often need to be readable)
# cli/
# scripts/

# Version or metadata files
# __version__.py
# _version.py
# __about__.py
